# url-encoder
This is a python script that helps with url encoding.



Hello everyone thankyou for checking out my url encoder!

This is a simple script that url encodes key characters or all characters.

This script is extremely helpful in multiple cases... whether it be XSS, SQLI or open redirect.




# You can get this script with the following commands

git clone https://github.com/YSSVirus/url-encoder.git

cd url-encoder

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 url-encoder.py

(if you want to be able to use it straight from command line add the following line into your ~/.bashrc file or if you use qterminal its ~/.zshrc)
alias url-encoder='python3 {full path to script file}'

if you do this then you willl be able to call the script like this

url-encoder



# Plans
I plan on making this a payload encoder with multiple methods
